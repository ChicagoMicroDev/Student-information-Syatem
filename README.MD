#### Goal:
- This repo is all about learning. The topic is Java and Test-Driven Development (TDD). We will be using Jeff Langr's book, *Agile Java*: [http://langrsoft.com/books-2/#agileJava].
- We will examine how to integrate Java and TDD  throughout the entire development lifecycle, helping to leverage efficient development techniques. We investigate how to translate oral requirements into practical tests, and then how to use those tests to create reliable, high-performance Java code that solves real problems.

- Additionally, we will be gaining experience using Gradle and Jenkins.
